# **Providers Directory**

Providers in React provide a way to share state and functionality across multiple components without the need to manually pass props at every level. Providers are part of the React Context API, enabling global state management.

## **ModalProvider.tsx**
The `ModalProvider` component in this project is in charge of rendering the `ProModal` component. Similar to the previous project, it avoids server-side rendering errors by ensuring the modal is rendered only on the client-side. Modals can cause hydration errors during the rendering process if not managed correctly.

The `ProModal` component likely provides a modal dialog that includes professional or pro features of the application. It may be used to upsell these features to users, inform users of pro benefits, or manage pro feature activations.

The `isMounted` state and the associated `useEffect` hook ensure that the `ProModal` component is only rendered on the client side, which can prevent hydration errors during the initial page load.

Overall, the `ModalProvider` component plays a vital role in the application, managing the rendering of modals and providing an interface for displaying pro feature information to users in a consistent and error-free manner.
